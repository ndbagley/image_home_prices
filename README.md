# Predictive Power of Images in House Prices


This project explores the power that images have in neural networks when predicting house prices. A baseline MLP is trained using only tabular data to predict house prices. Then images are introduced into the dataset and feature vectors are extracted from each image using a CNN. These features are combined with the tabular data and run through another neural network to see how much predictive power the images add to the model.
